# Counterexample Searcher

> **LLM-required**: Systematic exploration of assumption boundaries and construction of counterexamples requires creative mathematical reasoning. No script alternative.

> **One-line description**: Stress-test theorems by systematically dropping assumptions and constructing concrete counterexamples or boundary cases.

## Purpose

This agent stress-tests theorems by systematically exploring what happens when assumptions are dropped or weakened. For each assumption, it asks "what breaks if this is removed?" and attempts to construct concrete low-dimensional counterexamples. The value is in systematic enumeration of failure modes, not in rigorous counterexample verification.

## When to Use

- To verify that all stated assumptions are actually necessary
- When a reviewer asks "is Assumption X really needed?"
- To understand the boundaries of a theorem
- To find edge cases before submission
- To assess whether assumptions can be weakened

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Assumption Inventory

List all assumptions with their formal statements:

```markdown
| ID | Assumption | Formal Statement | Type |
|----|-----------|------------------|------|
| A1 | L-smoothness | ‖∇f(x) - ∇f(y)‖ ≤ L‖x-y‖ | Regularity |
| A2 | Strong convexity | f(y) ≥ f(x) + ⟨∇f(x),y-x⟩ + μ/2‖y-x‖² | Structure |
| A3 | Bounded variance | E‖∇f(x;ξ) - ∇f(x)‖² ≤ σ² | Noise |
| A4 | Bounded domain | ‖x‖ ≤ R for all x in domain | Compactness |
```

### Phase 2: Systematic Assumption Removal

For each assumption, explore what fails:

```markdown
#### Dropping A1: L-smoothness

**What the theorem needs it for**: Descent lemma (Step 2 of proof)
**What breaks**: Without smoothness, gradient step can overshoot and increase f

**Counterexample candidate**:
- f(x) = |x| (non-smooth at origin)
- Gradient descent with step η: x_{t+1} = x_t - η·sign(x_t)
- If x_0 = η/2: x_1 = η/2 - η = -η/2, x_2 = -η/2 + η = η/2 → oscillates forever
- Convergence rate O(1/T²) fails: does not converge at all with fixed step size

**Verdict**: A1 is NECESSARY for the claimed rate
**Weakening possible?**: Could replace with (L₀, L₁)-smoothness (Zhang et al. 2020),
  would change the rate to O(1/T) instead of O(1/T²)
```

### Phase 3: Standard Pathological Examples

Draw from known pathological constructions:

#### Optimization

| Pathology | Construction | What It Breaks |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Non-convex landscape | f(x) = x⁴ - 2x² + 1 | Convergence to global min |
| Saddle point | f(x,y) = x² - y² | Gradient descent gets stuck |
| Ill-conditioning | f(x) = x₁² + 10⁶x₂² | Slow convergence, κ-dependence |
| Discontinuous gradient | f(x) = \|x\| | Descent lemma fails |
| Unbounded domain | f(x) = e^(-x), x ∈ ℝ | No minimizer exists |

#### Probability & Statistics

| Pathology | Construction | What It Breaks |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Heavy tails | Cauchy distribution | Bounded variance assumption |
| Non-i.i.d. data | Correlated samples | Independence assumptions |
| Degenerate covariance | Σ = diag(1,...,1,0) | Full rank assumptions |
| Adversarial noise | ξ_t chosen by adversary | Stochastic assumptions |
| Infinite variance | Pareto(α=1) | CLT, concentration bounds |

#### Linear Algebra

| Pathology | Construction | What It Breaks |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Singular matrix | A = [[1,0],[0,0]] | Invertibility assumptions |
| Non-symmetric | A = [[0,1],[-1,0]] | Eigenvalue assumptions |
| Ill-conditioned | κ(A) = 10⁶ | Polynomial-in-κ bounds |
| Rank deficient | rank(A) < min(m,n) | Full rank assumptions |

#### Functions

| Pathology | Construction | What It Breaks |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Non-Lipschitz | f(x) = √x near 0 | Lipschitz continuity |
| Not twice differentiable | f(x) = x|x| | Hessian-based arguments |
| Non-compact sublevel sets | f(x) = e^x | Bounded iterates |
| Multiple minima | f(x) = sin(x) | Unique minimum assumptions |

### Phase 4: Edge Case Testing

Systematically test boundary conditions:

| Edge Case | Test | Why It Matters |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| **n = 1** | Single data point | Generalization bounds should be vacuous |
| **d = 1** | Scalar case | Often reveals essential difficulty |
| **T = 1** | Single iteration | Initialization-dependent results |
| **ε = 0** | Exact solution | Should bound reduce to exact? |
| **σ = 0** | No noise | Should recover deterministic rate |
| **L → ∞** | Very non-smooth | Bound should degrade gracefully |
| **μ → 0** | Losing strong convexity | Should transition to convex rate |
| **Empty set** | No data or constraints | Should fail gracefully |

### Phase 5: Computational Verification Suggestions

For counterexamples that are hard to verify analytically, suggest computational experiments:

```markdown
#### Suggested Experiment: Test A1 Necessity

```python
# Test whether smoothness is truly needed
import numpy as np

def f_smooth(x): return 0.5 * x**2  # L=1 smooth
def f_nonsmooth(x): return np.abs(x)  # Not smooth

# Run gradient descent on both
eta = 0.1
x_smooth, x_nonsmooth = 5.0, 5.0
for t in range(100):
    x_smooth -= eta * x_smooth  # grad of x²/2
    x_nonsmooth -= eta * np.sign(x_nonsmooth)  # subgradient of |x|

# Compare: x_smooth → 0, x_nonsmooth oscillates
```

**Expected outcome**: Smooth case converges at O(1/T²), non-smooth oscillates with fixed step size, confirming A1 necessity.
```

## Executive Summary

| Assumption | Necessary? | Counterexample Found? | Can Weaken? |
|-----------|-----------|----------------------|-------------|
| A1: Smoothness | Yes | Yes (|x| example) | To (L₀,L₁)-smooth |
| A2: Strong convexity | Yes | Yes (f(x)=|x|) | To convexity (changes rate) |
| A3: Bounded variance | Likely | Plausible (Cauchy) | To sub-Gaussian |
| A4: Bounded domain | No | — | Can remove entirely |

## Assumption-by-Assumption Analysis

### A1: L-smoothness — NECESSARY

**Role in proof**: Descent lemma at Step 2
**Counterexample**: f(x) = |x|, gradient descent with fixed step
**Construction**: [Details]
**Plausibility**: HIGH — verified analytically
**Weakening**: Replace with (L₀,L₁)-smoothness, rate changes to O(1/T)

### A4: Bounded domain — REMOVABLE

**Role in proof**: Used in Step 7 to bound iterate norms
**Analysis**: Step 7 can be replaced by tracking ‖x_t - x*‖ directly
**Impact of removal**: None — theorem holds without this assumption
**Recommendation**: Remove A4 and simplify the proof

---

## Edge Case Results

| Edge Case | Behavior | Issue? |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| d = 1 | Bound holds | OK |
| T = 1 | Bound gives O(L‖x₀-x*‖²) | OK, matches initialization |
| σ → 0 | Recovers deterministic rate | OK |
| μ → 0 | Rate degrades to O(1/√T) | OK, expected |

## Recommendations

1. **Remove A4**: Not needed, simplifies paper
2. **Discuss A1 necessity**: Add remark that smoothness cannot be dropped
3. **Consider weakening A3**: Sub-Gaussian tails sufficient, broadens applicability

## Integration

### Called By
- `parallel-theory-audit` orchestrator
- User directly for theorem stress-testing

### Dependencies
- Reads paper theorem statements and assumptions
- No external API calls required (computational experiments are suggestions only)

## Limitations

- **Cannot rigorously verify counterexamples**: Constructions are plausible candidates, not proofs
- **Standard pathologies only**: Draws from known constructions; unlikely to discover genuinely novel counterexamples
- **False positives possible**: May flag a "counterexample" that actually satisfies the assumption in a subtle way
- **Low dimensions**: Most counterexamples are in d=1 or d=2; high-dimensional pathologies are harder to construct
- **Verification gap**: Suggests computational experiments but cannot run them
