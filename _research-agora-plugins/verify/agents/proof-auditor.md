# Proof Auditor

> **LLM-required**: Verifying logical reasoning in proofs requires deep mathematical understanding. No script alternative.

> **One-line description**: Decompose proofs into atomic logical steps and verify each step, flagging gaps, errors, and unjustified leaps.

## Purpose

This agent is the theoretical analogue of `claim-auditor`. Where claim-auditor checks empirical evidence, proof-auditor checks mathematical reasoning. It decomposes each proof into atomic steps, verifies that each step follows from its premises, tracks which assumptions are consumed, and flags common mathematical errors.

## When to Use

- Before submission to verify proof correctness
- When a reviewer questions a specific proof step
- When extending or modifying an existing proof
- As part of `parallel-theory-audit` orchestrator
- When checking proofs contributed by co-authors

## MODE SELECTION

### Parallel Mode (Default for Papers with >3 Proofs)
```
If: Paper has >3 proofs OR user requests "parallel proof audit"
Then: Delegate to parallel-theory-audit orchestrator
Trade: lower wall-clock at higher token cost. Uses inline proof decomposition plus proof-step-verifier workers.
```

### Sequential Mode (Fallback)
```
If: Paper has ≤3 proofs OR single proof requested OR parallel fails
Then: Execute sequential workflow below
Benefits: More detailed analysis, deeper reasoning per step
```

## Theoretical Evidence Hierarchy (T1-T6)

Rate all proofs on this scale:

| Level | Label | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
> **Evidence scales are defined once**, in
> [`plugins/verify/config/EVIDENCE_SCALES.md`](../config/EVIDENCE_SCALES.md):
> L1–L6 for empirical claims, T1–T6 for theoretical ones, with the venue bars
> and the downgrade rule. Read the levels from there rather than from a copy —
> four copies of this scale had already drifted.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Proof Inventory

For each theorem-like environment, catalog:
- Statement (what is being proved)
- Proof location (inline, appendix, supplementary)
- Proof length and complexity estimate
- Assumptions explicitly referenced

### Phase 2: Step Decomposition

Decompose each proof into atomic logical steps:

```markdown
#### Proof of Theorem 1

**Step 1** [Setup]
- Action: Define auxiliary quantity G(t) = f(x_t) - f(x*)
- Justification: Definition
- Verdict: VALID

**Step 2** [Inequality application]
- Action: Apply L-smoothness: f(y) ≤ f(x) + ⟨∇f(x), y-x⟩ + (L/2)‖y-x‖²
- Justification: Assumption A1 (L-smoothness)
- Assumptions consumed: A1
- Verdict: VALID

**Step 3** [Substitution]
- Action: Substitute y = x_{t+1} = x_t - η∇f(x_t)
- Justification: Algorithm definition (line 3)
- Verdict: VALID

**Step 4** [Algebraic manipulation]
- Action: Expand and simplify to get f(x_{t+1}) ≤ f(x_t) - η(1 - ηL/2)‖∇f(x_t)‖²
- Justification: Algebra
- Verdict: SUSPICIOUS — verify sign in expansion of ⟨∇f(x), -η∇f(x)⟩ = -η‖∇f(x)‖²

**Step 5** [Gap detected]
- Action: "It follows that..." convergence rate is O(1/T)
- Justification: None provided
- Verdict: GAP — telescoping argument and step size choice not shown
```

### Phase 3: Common Error Detection

Check for these frequent mathematical errors:

#### Inequality Errors
| Error | Description | Detection |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **Wrong direction** | Using ≤ when ≥ is correct | Check each inequality application direction |
| **Cauchy-Schwarz misuse** | ⟨x,y⟩ ≤ ‖x‖‖y‖ applied incorrectly | Verify inner product signs |
| **Jensen's inequality** | Convex/concave confusion | Check function convexity matches inequality |
| **AM-GM application** | Wrong number of terms | Count terms in arithmetic/geometric means |
| **Triangle inequality** | ‖x+y‖ ≤ ‖x‖+‖y‖ vs reverse | Check direction and norm type |

#### Algebraic Errors
| Error | Description | Detection |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **Dropped terms** | Terms disappear between steps | Compare term count before/after |
| **Sign errors** | Incorrect signs in expansion | Verify each sign in products |
| **Missing absolute values** | |x| needed but omitted | Check where non-negativity assumed |
| **Wrong exponent** | x² vs x in bounds | Track powers through derivation |
| **Dimension mismatch** | Scalar-vector confusion | Verify dimensional consistency |

#### Logic Errors
| Error | Description | Detection |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **Swapped quantifiers** | ∀∃ vs ∃∀ | Parse quantifier structure |
| **Vacuous truth** | Proving P→Q when P is never true | Check condition satisfiability |
| **Circular reasoning** | Using the conclusion as a premise | Track dependency chain |
| **Proof by example** | Single instance for universal claim | Check generality of argument |
| **Hidden regularity** | Assuming more smoothness than stated | Compare with assumptions |

#### Limit/Measure Errors
| Error | Description | Detection |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **Invalid limit exchange** | lim/∫ or lim/∑ swap without justification | Check dominated convergence conditions |
| **Sup/inf confusion** | sup where inf intended or vice versa | Verify optimization direction |
| **Probability measure** | P(A∩B) ≠ P(A)P(B) without independence | Check independence assumptions |
| **Expectation linearity** | E[f(X)] ≠ f(E[X]) for nonlinear f | Check Jensen's conditions |

### Phase 4: Assumption Tracking

For each proof, create an assumption consumption map:

```markdown
#### Assumption Usage in Proof of Theorem 1

| Step | Assumptions Used | First Use? |
|------|-----------------|------------|
| Step 2 | A1 (L-smoothness) | Yes |
| Step 5 | A2 (bounded variance) | Yes |
| Step 7 | A1 (L-smoothness) | No (reused) |
| Step 8 | A3 (strong convexity) | Yes |

**All assumptions consumed**: A1, A2, A3 ✓
**Unused stated assumptions**: A4 (bounded domain) — not needed for this result
**Unstated assumptions used**: Bounded iterates (used in Step 6 without statement)
```

### Phase 5: Gap Classification

For each identified gap, classify severity:

| Severity | Description | Action |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Critical** | Logical error that invalidates the result | Must fix before submission |
| **Major** | Significant gap that a skilled reader cannot fill | Should provide missing steps |
| **Minor** | Small gap that a knowledgeable reader can fill | Consider adding for completeness |
| **Style** | Proof works but presentation could be clearer | Optional improvement |

## Proof-by-Proof Analysis

### Theorem 1: Convergence Rate O(1/T)

**Statement**: Under Assumptions A1-A3, Algorithm 1 satisfies...
**Proof location**: Appendix A.1
**Steps**: 12
**Verdict**: T3 — PROOF_WITH_GAPS

#### Step-by-Step Verification

[Step decomposition as in Phase 2]

#### Issues Found

**[Major] Gap at Step 5**: Telescoping argument not shown
- The proof jumps from per-iteration bound to convergence rate
- Missing: sum over t=1..T, divide by T, use step size η = 1/(L√T)
- Fix: Add 3-4 lines showing the telescoping and averaging

**[Minor] Step 4**: Sign verification recommended
- Expansion of inner product term should be double-checked
- Likely correct but algebraically dense

#### Assumption Map
[As in Phase 4]

---

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)

1. **Theorem 1, Step 5**: Telescoping gap — add missing derivation steps
2. **Proposition 1**: No proof provided — add proof or cite source

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. Complete the telescoping argument in Theorem 1 proof
2. Provide proof for Proposition 1 or cite as known result

### Medium Priority
3. Make Assumption A4 usage explicit or remove if unnecessary
4. Add intermediate step in Lemma 1 for inequality at Step 3

### Low Priority
5. Consider moving Theorem 2 proof to main text (currently appendix-only)
```

## Integration

### Research State Extension

Populates `theory.theorems` in `research-state.json` with audit results:

```json
{
  "theory": {
    "theorems": [
      {
        "id": "thm1",
        "type": "theorem",
        "statement": "...",
        "assumptions_used": ["A1", "A2", "A3"],
        "proof_text": "...",
        "depends_on": ["lem1", "lem2"],
        "audit_result": {
          "level": "T3",
          "steps": 12,
          "issues": [...]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Called By
- `parallel-theory-audit` orchestrator
- User directly for proof verification

### Calls
- `parallel-theory-audit` inline proof-decomposition task (parallel mode)
- `proof-step-verifier` micro-skill (parallel mode)
- `theorem-dependency-mapper` (for context)

## Limitations

- **First-pass tool, not ground truth**: May miss subtle errors or hallucinate issues in correct proofs
- **Long proof chains**: Accuracy degrades for proofs with >20 steps
- **Novel techniques**: Less reliable for non-standard proof methods
- **Formal verification**: Cannot replace Lean/Coq for T1-level assurance
- **Domain specificity**: Most reliable for optimization, learning theory, and probability; less so for algebraic or geometric proofs
