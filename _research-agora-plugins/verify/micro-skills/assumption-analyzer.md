# Micro-Skill: Assumption Analyzer

> **LLM-required**: Assessing whether an assumption is standard and exploring alternatives requires broad mathematical knowledge. No script alternative.

> **One-line description**: Deep analysis of a single mathematical assumption — standardness, implications, weaker alternatives, and practical testability.

> [!important] Everything this skill returns is recalled, not retrieved.
> The convexity, smoothness and noise hierarchies below come from model memory.
> This skill makes **no external call** — it does not read the paper's proof, it
> does not look up whether a named condition is standard in the literature, and
> it cannot check that a proposed weaker alternative actually suffices.
>
> **Its output is a suggestion, never a finding.** Report it as
> `SUGGESTED — unverified` and never as a property of the paper. It must not
> contribute to a verdict, a criticality score, or a T1–T6 level; a reader has
> to check the alternative before it is worth anything.

> `parallel-theory-audit` enforces this at fan-in. `parallel-audit` and direct

## Purpose

This skill performs deep analysis of a single mathematical assumption. It determines whether the assumption is standard in the field, what it rules out, what weaker alternatives exist, and whether it can be verified in practice. This supports both proof verification (are assumptions reasonable?) and paper strengthening (can we weaken assumptions?).

## Parallelization Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Input scope** | Single assumption |
| **State requirements** | Stateless |
| **External calls** | None |
| **Typical runtime** | 10-20s |
| **Can run in parallel** | Yes |

## Algorithm

1. **Identify the assumption** — parse the mathematical statement and any conditions
2. **Match to known assumptions** — check against standard assumption hierarchies (convexity, smoothness, noise)
3. **Assess standardness** — determine frequency in the literature (ubiquitous/common/occasional/rare/novel)
4. **Analyze implications** — what does this assumption rule out? What scenarios are excluded?
5. **Find weaker alternatives** — identify less restrictive assumptions that might still suffice
6. **Find stronger alternatives** — identify more restrictive assumptions that would simplify proofs
7. **Assess testability** — can the assumption be verified on real data/models?
8. **Predict reviewer concern** — estimate likelihood a reviewer will challenge this assumption

## Constraints

- **DO**: Map assumptions to their standard names when they exist
- **DO**: Provide concrete examples of what is ruled out
- **DO**: Suggest actionable weaker alternatives
- **DON'T**: Verify whether the assumption holds for the paper's specific setup
- **DON'T**: Challenge the paper's experimental design
- **DON'T**: Access external resources
- **DON'T**: Analyze more than one assumption per invocation

## Analysis Framework

### Standardness Assessment

| Frequency | Definition | Examples |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Ubiquitous** | Used in >80% of papers in subfield | i.i.d. data, bounded loss |
| **Common** | Used in 30-80% of papers | L-smoothness, strong convexity |
| **Occasional** | Used in 10-30% of papers | Polyak-Lojasiewicz, restricted strong convexity |
| **Rare** | Used in <10% of papers | Specific structural assumptions |
| **Novel** | Not seen before | Paper-specific conditions |

### Known Assumption Hierarchies

#### Convexity Hierarchy (weakest to strongest)
1. Non-convex (no assumption)
2. Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition
3. Weak convexity / approximate convexity
4. Convexity
5. Strong convexity (mu-strongly convex)

#### Smoothness Hierarchy
1. Continuous
2. Lipschitz continuous
3. Differentiable
4. L-smooth (Lipschitz gradient)
5. Twice differentiable with bounded Hessian
6. Strongly smooth

#### Noise Hierarchy
1. Adversarial noise
2. Sub-exponential
3. Sub-Gaussian
4. Bounded variance
5. Bounded noise
6. No noise (deterministic)
