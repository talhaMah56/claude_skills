# Orchestrator: Parallel Claim Audit

> **LLM-required**: Orchestrating parallel audits requires coordinating multiple analysis agents. No script alternative.

> **One-line description**: Coordinates parallel verification of all claims in a research paper using micro-skill subagents.

## Purpose

This orchestrator parallelizes claim verification by:
1. Generating research state (claims, structure, evidence)
2. Partitioning claims by type for parallel processing
3. Spawning specialized micro-skills for each claim
4. Merging results into a unified audit report

Fan-out bounds wall-clock by the slowest worker rather than the sum. No speedup figure is published; see Performance Expectations.

## Orchestration Pattern

```
Phase 1: Setup (Sequential)
├── Check for existing research-state.json
├── If missing: invoke state-generator
├── Load research state
├── Partition claims by type
├── Pre-fetch evidence content
└── Plan subagent allocation

Phase 2: Fan-Out (Parallel)
├── Empirical Claims Group
│   └── For each claim: spawn an inline evidence-grading task
├── Theoretical Claims Group
│   └── For each claim: spawn an inline evidence-grading task
├── Novelty Claims Group
│   └── For each claim: spawn novelty-checker
├── Comparative Claims Group
│   └── For each claim: spawn an inline evidence-grading task + novelty-checker
├── Citation Verification
│   └── For key citations: spawn citation-verifier
└── Assumption Surfacing
    └── For each section: spawn assumption-analyzer

Phase 3: Fan-In (Sequential)
├── Collect all subagent results
├── Merge into unified claim registry
├── Run cross-referencer for consistency
├── Calculate audit statistics
├── Aggregate recommendations
└── Generate final report
```

## Input Specification

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["paper_path"],
  "properties": {
    "paper_path": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Path to paper (LaTeX dir, .tex file, or .pdf)"
    },
    "venue_target": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["neurips", "icml", "iclr", "aaai", "cvpr", "acl", "workshop", "arxiv", "other"],
      "default": "neurips"
    },
    "options": {
      "type": "object",

        "force_regenerate_state": {"type": "boolean", "default": false}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Claim Partitioning

```python
def partition_claims(research_state):
    """Partition claims by type for parallel processing."""
    partitions = {
        "empirical": [],      # → inline evidence grading
        "theoretical": [],    # → inline evidence grading
        "novelty": [],        # → novelty-checker
        "comparative": [],    # → inline evidence grading + novelty-checker
        "methodological": [], # → inline evidence grading
        "assumed": []         # → skip or minimal check
    }

    for claim in research_state["claims"]:
        partitions[claim["type"]].append(claim)

    return partitions
```

## Subagent Spawning

### For Empirical/Theoretical/Methodological Claims

```
SPAWN_SUBAGENT:
  task: Assess each evidence item independently against [EVIDENCE_SCALES.md](../config/EVIDENCE_SCALES.md), then grade the overall case by its weakest link except when code plus paper evidence qualifies for L1; apply the venue bar and downgrade rule, and return strength, verdict, issues, venue compliance, and actionable recommendations. Do not search externally, modify the claim, or assess novelty.
  input:
    claim:
      id: {claim.id}
      text: {claim.text}
      type: {claim.type}
    evidence: [
      # Pre-fetched from evidence_map
      {type: "table", ref: "tab1", content: "..."}
    ]
    venue_target: {venue_target}
  context:
    - Relevant table/figure content (pre-fetched)
    - Section text containing claim
  timeout: 60s
  on_error: retry_once
```

### For Novelty Claims

```
SPAWN_SUBAGENT:
  skill: novelty-checker
  input:
    claim:
      id: {claim.id}
      text: {claim.text}
      keywords: [extracted keywords]
    paper_date: {metadata.generated_at}
    paper_arxiv_id: {metadata.arxiv_id}
  context:
    - Claim text only (minimal context)
  timeout: 120s
  on_error: mark_inconclusive
```

### For Comparative Claims (Dual Processing)

```
SPAWN_SUBAGENT:
  task: Assess each comparison-evidence item independently against [EVIDENCE_SCALES.md](../config/EVIDENCE_SCALES.md), then grade the overall case by its weakest link except when code plus paper evidence qualifies for L1; apply the venue bar and downgrade rule, and return strength, verdict, issues, venue compliance, and actionable recommendations. Do not search externally, modify the claim, or assess novelty.
  input:
    claim: {claim}
    evidence: [comparison tables]
    venue_target: {venue_target}
  timeout: 60s

SPAWN_SUBAGENT:
  skill: novelty-checker
  input:
    claim: {claim}
    # Check if comparison baseline claims are accurate
  timeout: 120s
```

### For Key Citations

```
SPAWN_SUBAGENT:
  skill: citation-verifier
  input:
    citation: {citation_entry}
    claim_about_citation: {text referencing citation}
  timeout: 30s
  on_error: skip
```

### For Sections (Assumption Surfacing)

`assumption-analyzer` generates alternatives from recalled hierarchies rather
than reading them out of the paper, so its output enters the merged report as a
suggestion and never as a finding — the same provenance rule
`parallel-theory-audit` applies.

```
SPAWN_SUBAGENT:
  skill: assumption-analyzer
  input:
    section_id: {section.id}
    section_text: {section text}
    section_title: {section.title}
    claims_in_section: [claim IDs]
  context:
    - Section text only
  timeout: 45s
  on_error: skip
```

## Result Merging

### Claim Status Aggregation

```python
def merge_claim_results(grader_result, novelty_result=None):
    """Merge results from multiple subagents for a single claim."""
    result = {
        "claim_id": grader_result["claim_id"],
        "evidence_strength": grader_result["overall_strength"],
        "evidence_label": grader_result["overall_label"],
        "verdict": grader_result["verdict"],
        "issues": grader_result.get("evidence_assessment", [{}])[0].get("issues", []),
        "recommendations": grader_result.get("recommendations", []),
        "meets_venue_standard": grader_result.get("meets_venue_standard", True)
    }

    if novelty_result:
        result["novelty_status"] = novelty_result["novelty_verdict"]
        result["prior_work"] = novelty_result.get("prior_work", [])
        result["concurrent_work"] = novelty_result.get("concurrent_work", [])

        # Combine recommendations
        result["recommendations"].extend(novelty_result.get("recommendations", []))

    return result
```

### Conflict Resolution

| Conflict Type | Resolution Strategy |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Evidence-grader vs novelty-checker disagree | Trust novelty-checker for prior work; trust grader for evidence quality |
| Multiple graders for same claim | Take minimum strength (conservative) |
| Citation verifier finds error | Flag claim for review, add to recommendations |
| Cross-referencer finds inconsistency | Add to critical issues list |

### Statistics Calculation

```python
def calculate_statistics(merged_results):
    """Calculate audit summary statistics."""
    total = len(merged_results)
    verified = sum(1 for r in merged_results if r["verdict"] == "verified")
    weak = sum(1 for r in merged_results if r["verdict"] == "weak")
    unsupported = sum(1 for r in merged_results if r["verdict"] == "unsupported")
    novelty_challenged = sum(1 for r in merged_results
                            if r.get("novelty_status") == "challenged")

    return {
        "total_claims": total,
        "verified": verified,
        "verified_pct": round(100 * verified / total, 1) if total else 0,
        "weak_evidence": weak,
        "unsupported": unsupported,
        "novelty_challenged": novelty_challenged,
        "meets_venue": sum(1 for r in merged_results if r.get("meets_venue_standard", True))
    }
```

## Error Handling

| Error Type | Strategy |
|------------|----------|
| State generation fails | Abort with clear error message |
| Single claim grading fails | Mark as "audit_failed", continue with others |
| Novelty search times out | Mark as "inconclusive", add recommendation |
| Citation verification fails | Skip, note in report |
| >50% subagents fail | Abort, suggest sequential fallback |
| Cross-referencer fails | Skip consistency check, note limitation |

## Parallelism Limits

- **Maximum concurrent subagents**: 10
- **Maximum total subagents**: 50
- **If claims > 50**: Batch into groups of 50, process sequentially

### Batching Strategy

```python
def batch_claims(claims, batch_size=50):
    """Split claims into batches if too many."""
    for i in range(0, len(claims), batch_size):
        yield claims[i:i + batch_size]
```

## Fallback Mode

If parallel execution is not available or >50% subagent failures:

```
FALLBACK: sequential-audit
  Invoke: claim-auditor (original sequential agent)
  Log: "Falling back to sequential audit due to [reason]"
  Note: Results will be slower but equivalent
```

## What fan-out actually buys

**No speedup figure here has been measured.** Earlier revisions of this file
published a table of minutes and a "2-3x" multiplier; nothing produced them, and
an unverified performance claim in a marketplace built on verification is the
defect it exists to catch.

What is structurally true, and all that is claimed:

- Fan-out makes wall-clock a function of the **slowest single worker**, not the
  sum of all of them. With `N` independent items and a concurrency cap of `C`,
  the analysis phase takes roughly `ceil(N/C)` worker-durations rather than `N`.
- Setup and merge stay sequential, so they bound how much fan-out can help. On a
  paper with few claims the coordination cost can exceed the saving.
- Every worker is a separate model call, so **fan-out spends more tokens than
  sequential**, not fewer. It trades cost for latency.

If you want a number for your own papers, time a sequential run against a
parallel one on the same source and record both. Do not quote one from here.
