# Orchestrator: Parallel Theory Audit

> **LLM-required**: Orchestrating parallel theory verification requires coordinating multiple analysis agents. No script alternative.

> **One-line description**: Coordinates parallel verification of all proofs, assumptions, and notation in a theoretical paper.

## Purpose

This orchestrator parallelizes theoretical verification by:
1. Extending research state with theory section (theorems, proofs, assumptions)
2. Building a theorem dependency graph
3. Extracting proof steps in parallel
4. Verifying steps and analyzing assumptions and notation in parallel
5. Merging results into a unified theory audit report

Fan-out bounds wall-clock by the slowest worker rather than the sum. No speedup figure has been measured.

## Orchestration Pattern

```
Phase 1: Setup (Sequential)
├── Check for existing research-state.json
├── If missing: invoke state-generator (with theory parsing)
├── Load research state, verify theory section populated
├── Build theorem dependency graph via theorem-dependency-mapper
├── Compute criticality scores for verification priority
└── Plan subagent allocation based on proof count and complexity

Phase 2: Fan-Out Stage 1 (Parallel)
├── Proof Decomposition
│   └── For each proof: spawn an inline proof-decomposition task
├── Assumption Analysis
│   └── For each assumption: spawn assumption-analyzer
└── Notation Checking
    └── Spawn notation-consistency-checker (full paper)

Phase 3: Fan-Out Stage 2 (Parallel, depends on Phase 2)
├── Step Verification
│   └── For each extracted step: spawn proof-step-verifier
└── Derivation Checking
    └── For each derivation step: spawn proof-step-verifier (level: computation)

Phase 4: Fan-In (Sequential)
├── Collect all subagent results
├── Merge proof step verdicts into per-proof assessments
├── Cross-reference with dependency graph (criticality weighting)
├── Assign T1-T6 levels to each proof
├── Generate unified theory audit report
└── Update research-state.json with audit results
```

## Input Specification

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["paper_path"],
  "properties": {
    "paper_path": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Path to paper (LaTeX dir, .tex file, or .pdf)"
    },
    "venue_target": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["neurips", "icml", "iclr", "aaai", "cvpr", "acl", "workshop", "arxiv", "other"],
      "default": "neurips"
    },
    "options": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "skip_notation_check": {"type": "boolean", "default": false},
        "max_proofs": {"type": "integer", "default": 20},
        "force_regenerate_state": {"type": "boolean", "default": false}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Phase 1: Setup

### 1.1 Research State Check

```
If research-state.json exists AND has theory section:
  Load and use cached state
Else if research-state.json exists WITHOUT theory section:
  Re-run state-generator with --force to add theory parsing
Else:
  Run state-generator from scratch
```

### 1.2 Theorem Dependency Graph

Invoke `theorem-dependency-mapper` to build the DAG:
- Identify all theorem-like environments
- Extract explicit and implicit dependencies
- Compute criticality scores
- Determine verification priority order

### 1.3 Subagent Planning

| Paper Size | Proofs | Max Concurrent |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Small | 1-3 | 5 |
| Medium | 4-8 | 8 |
| Large | 9+ | 10 |

The concurrency cap is a real constraint and is enforced. Duration is not
predicted here — it depends on proof length and model latency, and no
measurement exists to base an estimate on.

## Phase 2: Fan-Out Stage 1

### Proof Decomposition

For each proof in research state:

```
SPAWN:
  task: Decompose the supplied proof into one mathematical operation per step, including trivial steps; do not verify steps or invent justifications, mark unexplained transitions unjustified, and cap the result at 50 steps while flagging overflow. For each step record step_id, action, justification and detail, depends_on edges, assumptions consumed, LaTeX, and complexity, then return proof_id, steps, total_steps, assumptions_used, and gap_count for proof-step-verifier.
  input:
    proof_id: [proof ID]
    theorem_statement: [statement being proved]
    proof_text: [full proof text]
    assumptions: [available assumptions]
  timeout: 45s
  on_error: mark proof as "extraction_failed", continue
```

### Assumption Analysis

For each formally stated assumption:

```
SPAWN: assumption-analyzer
  input:
    assumption_id: [assumption ID]
    assumption_text: [full text]
    context: [what it's used for]
    domain: [detected domain]
  timeout: 30s
  on_error: skip, note in report
```

### Notation Consistency

```
SPAWN: notation-consistency-checker
  input:
    paper_files: [list of .tex files]
  timeout: 60s
  on_error: skip notation check, note in report
```

## Phase 3: Fan-Out Stage 2

Depends on Phase 2 completion (needs extracted proof steps).

### Step Verification

For each extracted step:

```
SPAWN: proof-step-verifier
  input:
    step: [step object from extractor]
    premises: [prior steps + assumptions + definitions]
    theorem_context: [what the proof establishes]
  timeout: 30s
  on_error: mark step as "verification_failed"
```

### Derivation Checking

For steps classified as algebraic/inequality/gradient computations:

```
SPAWN: proof-step-verifier
  input:
    derivation_id: [step ID]
    from_expression: [starting expression]
    to_expression: [result expression]
    operation: [operation type]
    context: [surrounding context]
  timeout: 30s
  on_error: mark as "check_failed"
```

## Phase 4: Fan-In

### 4.0 Provenance Gate (run before aggregating anything)

Not every subagent in this fan-out verifies. `assumption-analyzer` proposes weaker and stronger alternatives from memorized hierarchies and makes no external call. Its output is a hypothesis about the paper, not a finding about it.

**Tag every incoming result with its provenance before it enters the merged report:**

| Source | Provenance | How it may appear in the report |
|---|---|---|
| `proof-step-verifier`, `cross-referencer` | checked against the paper's own text | as a finding |
| `notation-consistency-checker` | extracted by regex from the source | as a finding |
| `assumption-analyzer` | recalled | as a suggestion, never as a finding |

A recalled assumption hierarchy is carried into the output as `UNVERIFIED — <what would settle it>`. **It never contributes to the criticality score in 4.2 or the T1–T6 level in 4.3**, because a level assignment is a claim about the paper's proofs and a recalled hierarchy is not evidence about this paper.

This orchestrator is `verification-level: heuristic` for exactly this reason: it coordinates a mix of checkers and generators, and a report that flattens the two would launder recall into verification.

### 4.1 Per-Proof Assessment

For each proof, aggregate step verdicts:

```
Proof verdict rules:
- ALL steps valid → T2 (COMPLETE_PROOF)
- Some steps suspicious, no errors → T2 with caveats
- Any step marked "gap" → T3 (PROOF_WITH_GAPS)
- Any step marked "error" → NEEDS_FIX
- Extraction failed → T5 (INFORMAL_ARGUMENT) or T6
- No proof present → T6 (THEOREM_ASSERTION)
```

### 4.2 Criticality-Weighted Scoring

Weight issues by theorem criticality from dependency graph:
- Issue in high-criticality theorem: **Critical**
- Issue in medium-criticality lemma: **Major**
- Issue in low-criticality remark: **Minor**

### 4.3 T1-T6 Level Assignment

| Level | Label | Criteria |
|-------|-------|----------|
| T1 | FORMALLY_VERIFIED | Lean/Coq proof exists (not assessed by this tool) |
| T2 | COMPLETE_PROOF | All steps verified as valid |
| T3 | PROOF_WITH_GAPS | Proof present but has unjustified leaps |
| T4 | PROOF_SKETCH | High-level strategy only, key steps omitted |
| T5 | INFORMAL_ARGUMENT | Intuitive reasoning without formal proof |
| T6 | THEOREM_ASSERTION | Stated without proof or argument |

## Error Handling

| Error | Strategy |
|-------|----------|
| State generation fails | Abort with clear error |
| Single proof extraction fails | Mark proof as "extraction_failed", continue others |
| Single step verification fails | Mark step as "verification_failed", continue |
| Notation checker fails | Skip notation, note in report |
| >50% subagents fail | Abort parallel mode, suggest sequential `proof-auditor` |
| Dependency mapper fails | Continue without criticality scoring |

## Concurrency Limits

| Limit | Value | Reason |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Max concurrent Phase 2 agents | 10 | Avoid overwhelming executor |
| Max concurrent Phase 3 agents | 10 | Rate limiting |
| Max total subagents | 80 | Cap for very large papers |
| Steps exceeding 80 | Batch into groups of 40 | Sequential batches |

## Performance Expectations

Two-stage fan-out limits how much concurrency helps here: Phase 3 cannot start
until Phase 2 finishes, so the two stages add rather than overlap. Setup and
merge stay sequential on top of that. No figure is published, because none was
measured.
