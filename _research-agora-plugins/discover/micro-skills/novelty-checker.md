# Micro-Skill: Novelty Checker

> **Hybrid**: Prior work search uses MCP/API tools. LLM assesses novelty relative to discovered prior art.

> **One-line description**: Verify novelty claims by searching academic literature for prior and concurrent work.

## Purpose

This skill verifies claims about novelty ("first to...", "novel approach", "new method") by searching arXiv for potentially overlapping prior work. It identifies relevant papers, assesses overlap, and classifies work as prior (challenge) or concurrent (acknowledge).

## Parallelization Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Input scope** | Single claim |
| **State requirements** | Needs paper_date for temporal filtering |
| **External calls** | arXiv MCP tools |
| **Typical runtime** | 30-120s |
| **Can run in parallel** | Yes (rate-limited) |

  ]
}
```

## Algorithm

1. **Generate search queries**
   - If not provided, extract from claim text
   - Create 3-5 query variations:
     - Direct keywords: "[method] [application]"
     - Technique-focused: "[core technique] [domain]"
     - Problem-focused: "[problem statement]"
     - Synonym expansion

2. **Execute arXiv searches**
   - Use `mcp__arxiv__search_papers` for each query
   - Filter results by date (before paper_date)
   - Limit to 10 results per query
   - Rate limit: max 3 requests per second

3. **Filter and rank results**
   - Exclude self-citations (paper_arxiv_id)
   - Rank by relevance to claim
   - Classify temporal relationship:
     - **Prior**: > 6 months before submission
     - **Concurrent**: within 6 months of submission
     - **After**: ignore

4. **Assess overlap for relevant papers**
   - For high-relevance papers (top 3-5):
     - Read abstract via `mcp__arxiv__get_paper_by_id`
     - Determine overlap with claimed novelty
     - Document specific overlap

5. **Generate verdict**
   - `confirmed`: No relevant prior work found
   - `challenged`: High-relevance prior work exists
   - `requires_clarification`: Partial overlap, claim could be refined

6. **Generate recommendations**
   - If challenged: How to revise claim
   - If concurrent: What to cite/acknowledge
   - If confirmed: Note search limitations

## Search Strategies

### Query Generation

| Claim Pattern | Query Strategy | Example |
|---------------|----------------|---------|
| "first to X" | Direct: X | "transformer protein folding" |
| "novel [method]" | Method + domain | "attention mechanism NLP" |
| "new approach to [problem]" | Problem keywords | "efficient graph neural networks" |
| "unique [property]" | Property + method | "linear attention transformer" |

### Keyword Extraction

Extract from claim text:
- Technical terms (capitalized, hyphenated)
- Method names
- Application domains
- Metrics mentioned

### Synonym Expansion

| Term | Synonyms |
|------|----------|
| transformer | attention mechanism, self-attention |
| neural network | deep learning, NN |
| efficient | fast, scalable, lightweight |
| novel | new, first, unique |

## Temporal Classification

| Category | Timing | Impact on Novelty |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| **Prior work** | > 6 months before | Challenges novelty |
| **Concurrent** | ± 6 months | Acknowledge, doesn't invalidate |
| **After** | After submission | Ignore |

## MCP Tool Usage

```
# Search for papers
mcp__arxiv__search_papers(
  query="transformer protein folding",
  maxResults=10,
  sortBy="relevance"
)

# Get paper details
mcp__arxiv__get_paper_by_id(
  ids=["2106.04426"]
)
```

## Constraints

- **DO**: Search multiple query variations
- **DO**: Filter by temporal relationship
- **DO**: Provide specific overlap descriptions
- **DO**: Generate actionable recommendations
- **DON'T**: Make more than 5 searches per claim
- **DON'T**: Return more than 10 relevant papers
- **DON'T**: Search non-arXiv sources
- **DON'T**: Verify other claim types (empirical, etc.)

## Error Handling

| Error Condition | Response |
|-----------------|----------|
| ArXiv API unavailable | Return `{"error": "ArXiv API unavailable", "code": "API_ERROR"}` |
| No search results | Return `confirmed` with note about search limitations |
| Rate limited | Retry with backoff, max 3 attempts |
| paper_date missing | Use current date, note in output |

## Context Requirements

| Context Item | Required | Source |
|--------------|----------|--------|
| Claim | Yes | Direct input |
| paper_date | Recommended | research-state.json metadata |
| paper_arxiv_id | Recommended | For self-exclusion |
| keywords | No | Auto-extracted if missing |
