# Argument Autopsy

Visualize the logical skeleton of a paper's argument as a claim-evidence dependency graph. Surface invisible structural gaps that cause reviewer comments like "the argument doesn't flow" or "this claim is unsupported."

> **LLM-required**: Extracting implicit claims, mapping logical dependencies, and assessing evidence quality requires deep reading comprehension and domain judgment. No script alternative.

## Core Philosophy

"My advisor says it doesn't flow" is the most common complaint about paper drafts. The problem is that argument structure is invisible in prose. You can't fix what you can't see.

This skill makes the invisible visible. It extracts every claim (explicit and implicit), maps each one to its supporting evidence, and renders the result as a structured DAG. Once you SEE the gaps — the missing links, the orphan claims, the assertions masquerading as proven results — fixing them is straightforward.

The autopsy reads and analyzes. It never rewrites the paper.

## Workflow

1. **Load research state**: Generate or read `research-state.json` before analyzing prose.
2. **Read the full paper or section**: Read without judgment. Understand the intended argument before dissecting it.
3. **Extract all claims**: Both explicit ("We show that X") and implicit (claims embedded in framing or word choice). Number them C1, C2, ...
4. **Build the evidence inventory**: Run the scripted pass below over `structure.figures + structure.tables + structure.theorems + citations`; read only to map that inventory to claims.
5. **Map claim-evidence dependencies**: Which evidence supports which claim? Which claims depend on other claims? Save the claim dependencies as `claim-graph.json`.
6. **Grade evidence quality**: Assign L1-L6 levels to each piece of evidence.
7. **Identify gaps**: Run the cycle check below, then identify missing links, orphans, and scope mismatches.
8. **Render the DAG**: Produce a structured visualization of the argument skeleton.
9. **Diagnose and recommend**: Prioritized list of fixes with estimated effort.

## Scripted Passes

Build the evidence inventory from parsed state:

```bash
python3 - research-state.json <<'PY'
import json
import sys
from pathlib import Path

state = json.loads(Path(sys.argv[1]).read_text())
sources = [
    *(('figure', item) for item in state['structure']['figures']),
    *(('table', item) for item in state['structure']['tables']),
    *(('theorem', item) for item in state['structure']['theorems']),
    *(('citation', item) for item in state['citations']),
]
inventory = [
    {"evidence_id": f"E{index}", "type": kind, "source": item}
    for index, (kind, item) in enumerate(sources, start=1)
]
print(json.dumps({"evidence_inventory": inventory}, indent=2))
PY
```

Write `claim-graph.json` as a mapping from each claim ID to the claim IDs it
depends on, then run an actual cycle check:

```bash
python3 - claim-graph.json <<'PY'
import json
import sys
from graphlib import CycleError, TopologicalSorter
from pathlib import Path

graph = json.loads(Path(sys.argv[1]).read_text())
try:
    order = list(TopologicalSorter(graph).static_order())
except CycleError as error:
    print(json.dumps({"has_cycle": True, "cycle": list(error.args[1])}, indent=2))
else:
    print(json.dumps({"has_cycle": False, "topological_order": order}, indent=2))
PY
```

## Evidence Grading

> **Evidence scales are defined once**, in
> [`plugins/verify/config/EVIDENCE_SCALES.md`](../../verify/config/EVIDENCE_SCALES.md):
> L1–L6 for empirical claims, T1–T6 for theoretical ones, with the venue bars
> and the downgrade rule. Read the levels from there rather than from a copy —
> four copies of this scale had already drifted.

## Gap Types

### Missing Link

**Definition**: Claim A depends on Claim B, but the logical connection is asserted rather than proven.

**Example**: "Our method converges (C3)" depends on "the loss landscape is convex (C2)", but no proof of convexity is provided.

**Severity**: Critical if the missing link is on the path from evidence to a main claim. Minor if it's in peripheral discussion.

**Fix**: Add the missing proof, experiment, or citation.

### Orphan Claim

**Definition**: A claim exists in the paper but nothing depends on it. It doesn't support any higher-level claim, and no conclusion references it.

**Example**: "We also note that our method can handle non-IID data distributions (C7)" — but the paper never evaluates on non-IID data and no conclusion mentions this capability.

**Severity**: Minor for isolated claims. Concerning if it suggests the author lost track of the argument.

**Fix**: Either connect it to the main argument or remove it. If it's important, add evidence and thread it into the contribution list.

### Orphan Evidence

**Definition**: Evidence is presented (a table, figure, or proof) but not connected to any claim. It exists without rhetorical purpose.

**Example**: Table 4 shows runtime comparisons, but no claim in the paper discusses computational efficiency.

**Severity**: Minor (wasted space) unless the evidence contradicts a claim (then it's a vulnerability).

**Fix**: Either make an explicit claim that the evidence supports, or move it to the appendix, or remove it.

### Circular Reasoning

**Definition**: Claim A depends on Claim B, which depends on Claim A. The argument is self-referential.

**Example**: "Our method works because the representations are disentangled (C2). The representations are disentangled because our method learns them correctly (C3)."

**Severity**: Critical. Circular reasoning invalidates the argument.

**Fix**: Break the cycle by grounding one of the claims in independent evidence.

### Evidence Downgrade

**Definition**: A critical claim (core contribution, main result) is supported only by L5-L6 evidence. The claim's importance demands stronger evidence than what is provided.

**Example**: Main contribution: "Our method generalizes to unseen domains (C1)." Evidence: "We expect generalization because the architecture is domain-agnostic (L5)."

**Severity**: Critical for core claims. Minor for secondary claims.

**Fix**: Add experimental evidence (L2-L3) or a formal proof (L3).

### Assumption Gap

**Definition**: A proof or argument relies on an unstated assumption. The assumption may be reasonable, but it's never made explicit.

**Example**: Convergence proof assumes bounded gradients, but the assumption is never stated.

**Severity**: Critical if the assumption is non-obvious or potentially violated. Minor if it's standard in the field.

**Fix**: State the assumption explicitly. Discuss whether it holds in practice.

### Scope Mismatch

**Definition**: The scope of the evidence doesn't match the scope of the claim. Results on MNIST, claims about "vision tasks." Results on English text, claims about "natural language."

**Example**: "Our method is effective for medical imaging (C1)" supported by "We evaluate on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet (E2)."

**Severity**: Critical. This is the most common source of "overclaiming" reviewer complaints.

**Fix**: Either narrow the claim to match the evidence scope, or add evidence at the claimed scope.

### Diagnosis

[2-3 sentence summary of argument health. Is the argument structurally sound with minor gaps, or does it have critical missing links? What is the single most important thing to fix?]

### Recommended Fixes (Prioritized)

1. **[Most critical gap]**: [What to do] — Estimated effort: [low/medium/high]
2. **[Second gap]**: [What to do] — Estimated effort: [low/medium/high]
3. **[Third gap]**: [What to do] — Estimated effort: [low/medium/high]
```

## Analyzing Partial Drafts

When the paper is incomplete (e.g., methods written but experiments not yet done):

- Mark expected evidence as "Planned" rather than "Missing"
- Focus the gap analysis on the logical structure of what exists
- Flag claims that will need experimental support and specify what experiments would suffice
- This turns the autopsy into a planning tool: "here's what you need to run to close the gaps"

## Multi-Section Analysis

For full papers, analyze section by section and then synthesize:

1. **Introduction**: Extract promised contributions (these become the top-level claims)
2. **Methods**: Extract method claims and their theoretical backing
3. **Experiments**: Extract evidence and map to claims
4. **Discussion/Conclusion**: Check that all claims from the introduction are addressed

The most common gap: contributions promised in the introduction that are never demonstrated in experiments.

## Constraints

- **Read and analyze only.** This skill never rewrites the paper. It diagnoses structural issues and recommends fixes.
- **Distinguish explicit from implicit claims.** Implicit claims (embedded in word choice like "efficiently" or "robustly") still need evidence. Flag them.
- **Respect the author's argument.** The goal is to strengthen the argument the author is making, not to impose a different argument.
- **Be specific about locations.** Every gap must reference a section, paragraph, or sentence. "The argument has gaps" is not a diagnosis.
